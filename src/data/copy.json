We ran a secret experiment in an attempt to observe the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect target=_blank rel=noreferrer>online disinhibition effect</a>. Our theory: people would be more inclined to draw inappropriate images (i.e., penises) with no personal information attached to their submissions. Why? Without fail, any free-form drawing project on the internet yields phallic imagery. Despite our best algorithmic efforts to thwart these from surfacing, you will still notice two  exemplary moments if you watch the video above closely. We wanted to quantify this tendency."},{"type":"text","value":"To test the effect, people were asked to add their name for recognition or get notified when the flipbook results were ready. We split the group in two; half were prompted to draw a circle confirming they were a human before being asked for their information (name, phone number, or email), the other half were prompted to draw after we had their info."},{"type":"text","value":"The results were…surprisingly mild. We had <strong>5,899 participants;</strong> 3,308 submitted a drawing before giving their information, and 2,591 after. The results for both groups were similar. Our conclusion was that most likely the experiment was flawed. Regardless of the order of the prompts, people knew personal information was about to be collected. While the disinhibition effect wasn’t significant, the lack of subversiveness in general was quite surprising. Despite accepting all forms of drawing attempts, <strong>99.2% of people still adhered to the prompt</strong> by attempting a proper circle."},{"type":"img","value":{"src":"circles.png","alt":"a selection of circles from the secret experiment"}},{"type":"text","value":"Our small rebellious group yielded a meager <strong>four probable penises,</strong> some non-circle geometric shapes, hearts, flowers, human figures, and various other doodles."},{"type":"img","value":{"src":"subvert.png","alt":"a selection of non-circles from the secret experiment"}},{"type":"text","value":"That’s all for the recap.

However, this project relies on visual input and hand-eye coordination to accurately trace drawings, so it  can’t be used by individuals who are blind or have serious visual impairments.

We apologize for any exclusion this may cause and appreciate your understanding."}],"playgroundNote":"make one continuous line."}
