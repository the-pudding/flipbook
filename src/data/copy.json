This is different because frames are drawn in succession, dependent on the previous one. In that sense, I like our odds."},{"q":"Accessibility statement","a":"We try to make our projects accessible to as many people as possible. However, this project relies on visual input and hand-eye coordination to accurately trace drawings, so it  can’t be used by individuals who are blind or have serious visual impairments. We recognize this limitation and understand that it may not be accessible to everyone. We apologize for any exclusion this may cause and appreciate your understanding."}],"playgroundNote":"make one continuous line."}
